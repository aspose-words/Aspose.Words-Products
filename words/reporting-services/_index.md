     Export Reports to Many Famous Formats
    </h2>
    <p>
     Aspose.Words for Reporting Services offers a number of export formats. Feel free to export your reports to "native" Microsoft Word document formats such as DOC, DOCX, RTF, and WordML, or additional formats like ODT, HTML, MHTML. TXT, XPS &amp; ePub.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2title">
     High Fidelity, Identical to Report Design
    </h2>
    <p>
     Aspose.Words for Reporting Services exports reports to Microsoft Word files in such a way that they appear identical to the original report design as produced by the Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services' built-in renderers. You can choose between two modes of the export or try both layout types by changing a single configuration setting in order to find out which one suits your needs best:
    </p>
    <ul class="unstyled">
     <li>
      Flow Layout
     </li>
     <li>
      Positioned Layout
     </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Flow Layout
     </strong>
     produces "editable" documents that consist of simple paragraphs, tables, sections - this is similar in comparison to an office worker creating the document in Microsoft Word.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Positioned Layout
     </strong>
     produces reports with the most accurate conversion fidelity from RDL to Microsoft Word. Tables and matrices from reports are exported as Microsoft Word tables, while some elements are exported as positioned textboxes to keep the fidelity as close to the original design as possible.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="col-lg-12">
    <h2 class="h2title">
     Microsoft Word Automation - Not Needed
    </h2>
    <p>
     Aspose.Words for Reporting Services is built using managed code that never needs Microsoft Word to be installed on the machine to work with Word document formats. It is a perfect Microsoft Word automation alternative in terms of supported features, security, stability, scalability, speed, and price.
