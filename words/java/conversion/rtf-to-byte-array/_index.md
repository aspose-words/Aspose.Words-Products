 In order to render DOCM to BMP, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-words) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col title="How to Convert RTF to Byte Array via Java" %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 It is easy for the Java developers to load & convert RTF files to byte array for further manipulation tasks in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load input RTF File
1.  Create ByteArrayOutputStream object
1.  Save document to Stream
1.  Convert stream data to byte array
1.  Process data as of your requirement
1.  To convert byte array to RTF, Load byte array to ByteArrayInputStream
1.  Load stream into Document Object
1.  Use save method with output file path and SaveFormat.RTF

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

Before running the Java conversion sample source code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with Java Runtime Environment for JSP/JSF Application and Desktop Applications.
- Get latest version of Aspose.Words for Java directly from Maven.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="This sample code shows RTF to byte array Java Conversion" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
// Load the file.
Document rtf = new Document("soureSample.rtf");

// Create a new memory stream.
ByteArrayOutputStream out_Stream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
// Save to stream.
rtf.save(out_Stream, SaveFormat.RTF);

// Convert the document to byte array form.
byte[] rtf_Bytes = out_Stream.toByteArray();

// The bytes are now ready to be stored/processed.

// Now reverse the steps to load the bytes back into a document object.
ByteArrayInputStream in_Stream = new ByteArrayInputStream(rtf_Bytes);

// Load the stream into a new document object.
Document load_Rtf = new Document(in_Stream);
// Save the document.
load_Rtf.save("convertback.rtf",SaveFormat.RTF);

A Document Processing Library to perform a wide range of document management and manipulation tasks including RTF generation, editing, conversion, rendering and printing. .NET Word API supports all of word-processing formats as well as allows exporting or **converting RTF to HTML**, PDF, fixed-layout and most commonly used image & multimedia formats.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="RTF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/word-processing/rtf/" >}}
Introduced and documented by Microsoft, the Rich Text Format (RTF) represents a method of encoding formatted text and graphics for use within applications. The format facilitates cross-platform document exchange with other Microsoft Products, thus serving the purpose of interoperability. This capability makes it a standard of data transfer between word processing software and, hence, contents can be transferred from one operating system to another without losing document formatting. The file format specifications are available by Microsoft for public download and can be referred to from developer&rsquo;s perspective.
