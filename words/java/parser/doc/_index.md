```cs
 //Load DOC file containing images
Document doc = new Document(getMyDir() + "Images.doc");

// Get the collection of shapes.
NodeCollection shapes = doc.getChildNodes(NodeType.SHAPE, true);

int imageIndex = 0;
for (Shape shape : (Iterable<Shape>) shapes) {
    if (shape.hasImage()) {
        // Shape may contain images of many possible formats. 
        // Get file extension for each image, based on its format.
        String imageFileName = MessageFormat.format("File.ExtractImages.{0}{1}", imageIndex, FileFormatUtil.imageTypeToExtension(shape.getImageData().getImageType()));
        shape.getImageData().save(getArtifactsDir() + imageFileName);
        imageIndex++;
    }
}
// Similarly a lot more parser actions can be performed including
//Get all of a document comments and their replies
//Get the text of node and of all its children.
