 In order to digitally sign Microsoft Word RTF document, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use electronic signature API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-words) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

```cs
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
SignatureLine signatureLine = builder.insertSignatureLine(new SignatureLineOptions()).getSignatureLine();
doc.save("Document.NewSignatureLine.rtf");

SignOptions signOptions = new SignOptions();
signOptions.setSignatureLineId(signatureLine.getId());
java.nio.file.Path path = java.nio.file.Paths.get("SignatureImage.emf");
signOptions.setSignatureLineImage(Files.readAllBytes(path));

CertificateHolder certHolder = CertificateHolder.create("temp.pfx", "password");
DigitalSignatureUtil.sign("Document.NewSignatureLine.rtf", "Document.NewSignatureLine.rtf_out.rtf", certHolder, signOptions);

 Java Words API can be used to load, view and convert Microsoft Word and OpenDocument Formats like DOC, DOCX, ODT to PDF, XPS, HTML and various other formats. You can also create new documents from scratch and save them in the supported formats. It is a standalone API that is suitable for server side and backend systems where high performance is required. It does not depend on any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice. ‎

Introduced and documented by Microsoft, the Rich Text Format (RTF) represents a method of encoding formatted text and graphics for use within applications. The format facilitates cross-platform document exchange with other Microsoft Products, thus serving the purpose of interoperability. This capability makes it a standard of data transfer between word processing software and, hence, contents can be transferred from one operating system to another without losing document formatting. The file format specifications are available by Microsoft for public download and can be referred to from developer's perspective.
