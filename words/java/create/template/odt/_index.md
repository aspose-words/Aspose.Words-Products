 A template is a file with pre-applied formatting like tabs, styles, line spacing etc. Generating MS Word ODT file dynamically from templates within running application is easy. In order to generate a batch of documents with the same structure based on the template without requiring MS Office, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/java) 
 API that offers different features for document creation, manipulation and conversion using .NET platform.  For populating the predefined Word template, we’ll create a Word ODT file with the following placeholders as the content of the document: <code><<[s.getName()]>> says: "<<[s.getMessage()]>>.""</code> where <code>s</code> is the <code>Sender</code> class object that will be used to populate the template. Beside a predefine class like Sender in our case, One can also use XML, JSON and CSV data as a source data sources. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-words) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 It is easy for the developers to creat ODT files from template using ReportingEngine within running Word Automation applications for data processing in just a few lines of code. Reporting Engine supports different data sources including XML, JSON and CSV data.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Create the Document object having template’s path as parameter.
1.  Create and initialize an object of Sender class.
1.  Create ReportingEngine class object.
1.  Use ReportingEngine.buildReport() method to build the report having document template, data source, and data source name.
1.  Save created Word file using save() method..

ODT files are type of documents created with word processing applications that are based on OpenDocument Text File format. These are created with word processor applications such as free OpenOffice Writer and can hold content such as text, images, objects and styles. The ODT file is to Writer word processor what the DOCX is to Microsoft Word. Several applications including Google Docs and Google&rsquo;s web-based word processor included with Google Drive can open the ODT files for editing. Microsoft Word can also open ODT files and save it in to other formats such as DOC and DOCX.
