 Byte Array is helpful for data processing or storing. You can convert DOT file to Byte Array as well as a **Byte Array to DOT** document using C# language. In order to convert DOT to byte array, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net) 
 API that offers different features for document manipulation and conversion using .NET platform.

1.  Include the namespace in your class file
1.  Load input DOT File
1.  Initialize MemoryStream object
1.  Convert stream data to byte array
1.  Process data as of your requirement
1.  To convert byte array to DOT, Load byte array to MemoryStream
1.  Load stread into Document Object
1.  Use Save method with output file path and SaveFormat.Dot

```cs
// Create instance and load the DOT file from disk.
Document dot = new Document("SourceSample.dot");

// Create a new memory stream.
MemoryStream outStream = new MemoryStream();
// Save the document to stream.
dot.Save(outStream, SaveFormat.Dot);

// Convert the document to byte array.
byte[] dotBytes = outStream.ToArray();

// Bytes are ready to be processed/stored.

// In order to convert byte array to DOT
// Now reverse the steps to load the bytes back into a document object.
MemoryStream inStream = new MemoryStream(dotBytes);

// Load the stream into a new object.
Document load_dot = new Document(inStream);
// Save the file.
load_dot.Save("output.dot", SaveFormat.Dot);

Files with .DOT extension are template files created by Microsoft Word to have pre-formatted settings for generation of further DOC or DOCX files. A template file is created in order to have specific user settings that should be applied to subsequent files created from these. These settings include page margins, borders, headers, footers, and other page settings. Such templates are used in official documents such as company letterheads and standardized forms. The DOT file format is specific to Microsoft Word 2003 and earlier, but is supported by higher versions as well. Microsoft Word by default opens every new document based on normal.dot file. If modified, all the new files created will result in same settings as from the template file. In Microsoft Word 2007, the DOT file format has been replaced with Office OpenXML based DOTX file format.
