1.  Load the Word file in an instance of Document
1.  Create an instance of PdfSaveOptions
1.  Set EncryptionDetails.Permissions as per requirements
1.  Set user password via EncryptionDetails.UserPassword property

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Un-secure PDF documents can be easily printed or extracted, therefore developers may need to encrypt PDF files with user passwords, or just restrict PDF operations. In both cases,
 *Aspose.Words.Saving.PdfSaveOptions* 
 comes into play.

Word saves documents in OOXML DOCX format, by default, though it can also save documents in the proprietary DOC format, which was commonly used by earlier versions of Word. Templates saved in DOT and DOTX files are used to create documents that require a consistent look and feel.

    {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PDF" readMoreLink="" >}}
PDF was created by Adobe in 1990s to introduce a standard document representation that is independent of software, hardware as well as OS. PDF files nowadays can contain text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata and 3D objects.
