 Generating MS Word DOTM file dynamically from templates within running application is easy. In order to create Microsoft Word DOTM documents from scratch or just by populating the predefined Word templates without requiring MS Office, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net) 
 API that offers different features for document creation, manipulation and conversion using .NET platform.  For populating the predefined Word template, we’ll create a Word DOTM file with the following placeholders as the content of the document: <code><<[sender.Name]>> says: "<<[sender.Message]>>."</code> where <code>sender</code> is the <code>Sender</code> class object that will be used to populate the template. Beside a predefine class like Sender in our case, One can also use XML and JSON data as a source data sources.

A file with DOTM extension represents template file created with Microsoft Word 2007 or higher. It is similar to the popular DOCX file format other than it retains the user defined settings for reuse in case of creating new documents. Such documents are more often used in offices where a standard template file is generated with settings like page information, margins, default layout and macros, and is used to create new documents from it when required. DOTM files, however, save macros, that are a series of commands in the form of recorded actions for automatic completion of a task. This helps save time in carrying out actions that are repeated in completion of a task.
