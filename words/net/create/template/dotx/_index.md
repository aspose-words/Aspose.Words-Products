 Generating MS Word DOTX file dynamically from templates within running application is easy. In order to create Microsoft Word DOTX documents from scratch or just by populating the predefined Word templates without requiring MS Office, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net) 
 API that offers different features for document creation, manipulation and conversion using .NET platform.  For populating the predefined Word template, we’ll create a Word DOTX file with the following placeholders as the content of the document: <code><<[sender.Name]>> says: "<<[sender.Message]>>."</code> where <code>sender</code> is the <code>Sender</code> class object that will be used to populate the template. Beside a predefine class like Sender in our case, One can also use XML and JSON data as a source data sources.

A template file is created in order to have specific user settings that should be applied to subsequent flies created from these.
