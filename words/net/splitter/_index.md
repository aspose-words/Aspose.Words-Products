[.NET Word Library](/words/net/) is capable to split single word document into multiple files within .NET based applications. Developers can split word document data present in various sections or pages. Depending on scenarios, managing code to split documents by headings, by section, page by page or using a page range is quiet easy. API provides the [DocumentSplitCriteria](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/documentsplitcriteria) enumeration having members as PageBreak, ColumnBreak, SectionBreak and HeadingParagraph for defining the splitting criteria. Moreover, one can split the document at page breaks and heading paragraphs in the same export operation. If there is need of splitting a document by a specific level of heading paragraphs, like heading 1, 2 and 3, API provides [DocumentSplitHeadingLevel](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/htmlsaveoptions/properties/documentsplitheadinglevel) property. The output will be divided by paragraphs formatted with the specified heading level.
