 A template is a file with pre-applied formatting like tabs, styles, line spacing etc. Generating MS Word DOT file dynamically from templates within running application is easy. In order to generate a batch of documents with the same structure based on the template without requiring MS Office, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net) 
 API that offers different features for document creation, manipulation and conversion using .NET platform.  For populating the predefined Word template, we’ll create a Word DOT file with the following placeholders as the content of the document: <code><<[sender.Name]>> says: "<<[sender.Message]>>."</code> where <code>sender</code> is the <code>Sender</code> class object that will be used to populate the template. Beside a predefine class like Sender in our case, One can also use XML and JSON data as a source data sources.

 It is easy for the developers to creat DOT files from template using ReportingEngine within running Word Automation applications for data processing in just a few lines of code. Reporting Engine supports different datasources including XML and JSON data.

1.  Include the namespace in your class file
1.  Create Document class Object with the Word template’s path as parameter.
1.  Create and initialize Sender class object.
1.  Instantiate ReportingEngine class.
1.  Populate the templates using ReportingEngine.BuildReport() having Document's object, data source and data source name as parameters.
1.  Save created Word DOT file using Save() method.

Files with .DOT extension are template files created by Microsoft Word to have pre-formatted settings for generation of further DOC or DOCX files. A template file is created in order to have specific user settings that should be applied to subsequent files created from these. These settings include page margins, borders, headers, footers, and other page settings. Such templates are used in official documents such as company letterheads and standardized forms. The DOT file format is specific to Microsoft Word 2003 and earlier, but is supported by higher versions as well. Microsoft Word by default opens every new document based on normal.dot file. If modified, all the new files created will result in same settings as from the template file. In Microsoft Word 2007, the DOT file format has been replaced with Office OpenXML based DOTX file format.
