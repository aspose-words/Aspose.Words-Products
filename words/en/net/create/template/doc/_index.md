 A template is a file with pre-applied formatting like tabs, styles, line spacing etc. Generating MS Word DOC file dynamically from templates within running application is easy. In order to generate a batch of documents with the same structure based on the template without requiring MS Office, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net) 
 API that offers different features for document creation, manipulation and conversion using .NET platform.  For populating the predefined Word template, we’ll create a Word DOC file with the following placeholders as the content of the document: <code><<[sender.Name]>> says: "<<[sender.Message]>>."</code> where <code>sender</code> is the <code>Sender</code> class object that will be used to populate the template. Beside a predefine class like Sender in our case, One can also use XML and JSON data as a source data sources.
