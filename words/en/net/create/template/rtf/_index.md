 A template is a file with pre-applied formatting like tabs, styles, line spacing etc. Generating MS Word RTF file dynamically from templates within running application is easy. In order to generate a batch of documents with the same structure based on the template without requiring MS Office, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net) 
 API that offers different features for document creation, manipulation and conversion using .NET platform.  For populating the predefined Word template, we’ll create a Word RTF file with the following placeholders as the content of the document: <code><<[sender.Name]>> says: "<<[sender.Message]>>."</code> where <code>sender</code> is the <code>Sender</code> class object that will be used to populate the template. Beside a predefine class like Sender in our case, One can also use XML and JSON data as a source data sources.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="RTF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/word-processing/rtf/" >}}
Introduced and documented by Microsoft, the Rich Text Format (RTF) represents a method of encoding formatted text and graphics for use within applications. The format facilitates cross-platform document exchange with other Microsoft Products, thus serving the purpose of interoperability. This capability makes it a standard of data transfer between word processing software and, hence, contents can be transferred from one operating system to another without losing document formatting. The file format specifications are available by Microsoft for public download and can be referred to from developer&rsquo;s perspective.
