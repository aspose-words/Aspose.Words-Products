 Generating MS Word DOTX file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create DOTX documents from scratch having similar result as of New document in Microsoft Word without requiring MS Office, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp) 
 API that offers different features for document creation, manipulation and conversion using C++ platform. One can easily enhance code to insert images, text, lists, tables and other elements in newly created Word documents.

 It is easy for the developers to creat, load, modify and convert DOTX files within running Word Automation applications for data processing in just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Use [Document class](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) object for initialization.
1.  Create [DocumentBuilder class](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document_builder) object and initialize it with the Document object.
1.  Save the file using Save(.) method.

```cs
// Initializing a Document.
System::SharedPtr<Document> dotx = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// Document builder for adding content within the document.
System::SharedPtr<DocumentBuilder> bldr = System::MakeObject<DocumentBuilder>(dotx);
// Add all relevant content
bldr->Writeln(u"relevant content!"); 
// Save the document to any specified location.
dotx->Save(u"document.dotx"); 

// Enhance the code to edit or update the created Word DOTX file
// Add images, insert table and lists

Files with DOTX extension are template files created by Microsoft Word to have pre-formatted settings for generation of further DOCX files. A template file is created in order to have specific user settings that should be applied to subsequent flies created from these. These settings include page margins, borders, headers, footers, and other page settings. Such templates are used in official documents such as company letterheads and standardized forms.
