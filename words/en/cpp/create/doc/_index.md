 Generating MS Word DOC file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create DOC documents from scratch having similar result as of New document in Microsoft Word without requiring MS Office, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp) 
 API that offers different features for document creation, manipulation and conversion using C++ platform. One can easily enhance code to insert images, text, lists, tables and other elements in newly created Word documents.

1.  Use [Document class](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) object for initialization.
1.  Create [DocumentBuilder class](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document_builder) object and initialize it with the Document object.
1.  Save the file using Save(.) method.
