 Generating MS Word DOCM file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create DOCM documents from scratch having similar result as of New document in Microsoft Word without requiring MS Office, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp) 
 API that offers different features for document creation, manipulation and conversion using C++ platform. One can easily enhance code to insert images, text, lists, tables and other elements in newly created Word documents.

 It is easy for the developers to creat, load, modify and convert DOCM files within running Word Automation applications for data processing in just few lines of code.

1.  Use [Document class](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) object for initialization.
1.  Create [DocumentBuilder class](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document_builder) object and initialize it with the Document object.
1.  Save the file using Save(.) method.

```cs
// Initializing a Document.
System::SharedPtr<Document> docm = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// Document builder for adding content within the document.
System::SharedPtr<DocumentBuilder> bldr = System::MakeObject<DocumentBuilder>(docm);
// Add all relevant content
bldr->Writeln(u"relevant content!"); 
// Save the document to any specified location.
docm->Save(u"document.docm"); 

// Enhance the code to edit or update the created Word DOCM file
// Add images, insert table and lists

A Document Processing Library to perform a wide range of document creation, management and manipulation tasks including DOCM generation, editing, conversion, rendering and printing. C++ Word library supports all of word-processing formats as well as allows exporting or converting DOCM to PDF, HTML, fixed-layout and most commonly used image & multimedia formats.

DOCM files are Microsoft Word 2007 or higher generated documents with the ability to run macros. It is similar to DOCX file format but the ability to run macros makes it different from DOCX. Like DOCX, DOCM files can be store text, images, tables, shapes, charts and other contents.The capability to run macros make it easy to save time by executing the series of commands in the form of recorded actions for automatic completion of a task. DOCM files can be opened and edited in Microsoft Word 2007 and above.
