 In order to digitally sign HTML document, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Words for Java](https://products.aspose.com/words/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use electronic signature API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-words) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

SignOptions signOptions = new SignOptions();
signOptions.setSignatureLineId(signatureLine.getId());
java.nio.file.Path path = java.nio.file.Paths.get("SignatureImage.emf");
signOptions.setSignatureLineImage(Files.readAllBytes(path));

CertificateHolder certHolder = CertificateHolder.create("temp.pfx", "password");
DigitalSignatureUtil.sign("Document.NewSignatureLine.html", "Document.NewSignatureLine.html_out.html", certHolder, signOptions);

 Java Words API can be used to load, view and convert Microsoft Word and OpenDocument Formats like DOC, DOCX, ODT to PDF, XPS, HTML and various other formats. You can also create new documents from scratch and save them in the supported formats. It is a standalone API that is suitable for server side and backend systems where high performance is required. It does not depend on any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice. ‎

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the extension for web pages created for display in browsers. Known as language of the web, HTML has evolved with requirements of new information requirements to be displayed as part of web pages. The latest variant is known as HTML 5 that gives a lot of flexibility for working with the language. HTML pages are either received from server, where these are hosted, or can be loaded from local system as well. Each HTML page is made up of HTML elements such as forms, text, images, animations, links, etc. These elements are represented by tags such as img, a, p and several others where each tag has start and end. It can also embed applications written in scripting languages such as JavaScript and Style Sheets (CSS) for overall layout representation.
