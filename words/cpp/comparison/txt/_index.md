 A basicВ documentВ comparison with
 [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp) 
 APIs can be done with just a few lines of code to compare two versions of a document to get the difference.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+  Load two TXT files with full path for comparison.
+  Assign one file as the base file.
+  Use get\_Revisions() with get\_Count() for differences.

A file with .TXT extension represents a text document that contains plain text in the form of lines. Paragraphs in a text document are recognized by carriage returns and are used for better arrangement of file contents. A standard text document can be opened in any text editor or word processing application on different operating systems. All the text contained in such a file is in human-readable format and represented by sequence of characters. Read More
