 A basicВ documentВ comparison with
 [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp) 
 APIs can be done with just a few lines of code to compare two versions of a document to get the difference.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

+  Load two PDF files with full path for comparison.
+  Assign one file as the base file.
+  Use get\_Revisions() with get\_Count() for differences.

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. PDF files can be opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader/Writer as well in most modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox via extensions/plug-ins. Most of the commercially available software suites also offer conversion of their documents to PDF file format without the requirement of any additional software component. Thus, PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
