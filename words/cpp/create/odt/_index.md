 Generating MS Word ODT file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create ODT documents from scratch having similar result as of New document in Microsoft Word without requiring MS Office, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp) 
 API that offers different features for document creation, manipulation and conversion using C++ platform. One can easily enhance code to insert images, text, lists, tables and other elements in newly created Word documents.

 It is easy for the developers to creat, load, modify and convert ODT files within running Word Automation applications for data processing in just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Use [Document class](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) object for initialization.
1.  Create [DocumentBuilder class](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document_builder) object and initialize it with the Document object.
1.  Save the file using Save(.) method.

```cs
// Initializing a Document.
System::SharedPtr<Document> odt = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// Document builder for adding content within the document.
System::SharedPtr<DocumentBuilder> bldr = System::MakeObject<DocumentBuilder>(odt);
// Add all relevant content
bldr->Writeln(u"relevant content!"); 
// Save the document to any specified location.
odt->Save(u"document.odt"); 

// Enhance the code to edit or update the created Word ODT file
// Add images, insert table and lists

A Document Processing Library to perform a wide range of document creation, management and manipulation tasks including ODT generation, editing, conversion, rendering and printing. C++ Word library supports all of word-processing formats as well as allows exporting or converting ODT to PDF, HTML, fixed-layout and most commonly used image & multimedia formats.

ODT files are type of documents created with word processing applications that are based on OpenDocument Text File format. These are created with word processor applications such as free OpenOffice Writer and can hold content such as text, images, objects and styles. The ODT file is to Writer word processor what the DOCX is to Microsoft Word. Several applications including Google Docs and Google&rsquo;s web-based word processor included with Google Drive can open the ODT files for editing. Microsoft Word can also open ODT files and save it in to other formats such as DOC and DOCX.
