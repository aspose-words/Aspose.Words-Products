 Generating MS Word DOT file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create DOT documents from scratch having similar result as of New document in Microsoft Word without requiring MS Office, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Words for C++](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp) 
 API that offers different features for document creation, manipulation and conversion using C++ platform. One can easily enhance code to insert images, text, lists, tables and other elements in newly created Word documents.

 It is easy for the developers to creat, load, modify and convert DOT files within running Word Automation applications for data processing in just few lines of code.

1.  Use [Document class](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document) object for initialization.
1.  Create [DocumentBuilder class](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document_builder) object and initialize it with the Document object.
1.  Save the file using Save(.) method.

```cs
// Initializing a Document.
System::SharedPtr<Document> dot = System::MakeObject<Document>();
// Document builder for adding content within the document.
System::SharedPtr<DocumentBuilder> bldr = System::MakeObject<DocumentBuilder>(dot);
// Add all relevant content
bldr->Writeln(u"relevant content!"); 
// Save the document to any specified location.
dot->Save(u"document.dot"); 

// Enhance the code to edit or update the created Word DOT file
// Add images, insert table and lists

A Document Processing Library to perform a wide range of document creation, management and manipulation tasks including DOT generation, editing, conversion, rendering and printing. C++ Word library supports all of word-processing formats as well as allows exporting or converting DOT to PDF, HTML, fixed-layout and most commonly used image & multimedia formats.

Files with .DOT extension are template files created by Microsoft Word to have pre-formatted settings for generation of further DOC or DOCX files. A template file is created in order to have specific user settings that should be applied to subsequent files created from these. These settings include page margins, borders, headers, footers, and other page settings. Such templates are used in official documents such as company letterheads and standardized forms. The DOT file format is specific to Microsoft Word 2003 and earlier, but is supported by higher versions as well. Microsoft Word by default opens every new document based on normal.dot file. If modified, all the new files created will result in same settings as from the template file. In Microsoft Word 2007, the DOT file format has been replaced with Office OpenXML based DOTX file format.
